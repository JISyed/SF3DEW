SFML 3D Engine Wrapper (SF3DEW)
======

Attempts to wrap easier to use OpenGL 3D functionality and extremely basic game engine functionality (like game object management, component-based game objects, very basic physics, time and randomization, etc.)

Notice that this is a wrapper and *not* a library (this project builds an EXE, not DLLs). The main library used is [SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML) (dynamically linked).

This is project is built on Visual Studios 2012 Express and target for a 32-bit executable.
