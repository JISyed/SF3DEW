SFML 3D Engine Wrapper (SF3DEW)
======

Attempts to wrap easier to use OpenGL 3D functionality and extremely basic game engine functionality (like game object management, component-based game objects, very basic physics, time and randomization, etc.)

Notice that this is a wrapper and *not* a library (this project builds an EXE, not DLLs). The main library used is [SFML](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML). Using SFML 2.1.

This is project is built on Visual Studios 2012 Express and target for a 32-bit executable. Various C++11 features are used, so porting requires a C++11 friendly compiler.

To compile, the project requires [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html), [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) (verison 2.1), and [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) installed on the C drive.
